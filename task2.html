    <h3>Petra</h3>
    <p>Inhabited since prehistoric times, this <strong>Nabataean</strong> caravan-city, situated between the Red Sea
         and the <strong>Dead Sea</strong>, was an important crossroads between Arabia, Egypt, and Syria-Phoenicia.
          Petra is half-built, half-carved into the rock, and is surrounded by mountains riddled
           with passages and gorges. It is one of the world's most famous archaeological sites,
            where ancient <strong>Eastern</strong> traditions blend with <strong>Hellenistic</strong> architecture.
